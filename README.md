# Baking App
An Android app that allows a baker-in-chief to share recipes with the world. The app user can select a recipe
and see video-guided steps for hoe to complete it. The recipes' instructions, ingredients, videos, and images
are fetched from a JSON file hosted online.

The app also includes a homescreen widget to enhance the user's experience by displaying ingredient list
for a desired recipe.

The app uses a Master/Detail approach to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets.
